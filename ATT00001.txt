p.s. - I did find a flaw in my previous code, that allowed a non-uniqueness in solutions (though I don't think
any of our previous solution cases actually suffered from this).  I'll explain it below in case it becomes an
issue, but I expect you can ignore this issue and just move forward with the new version.

The problem arose from my failing to consider the impact of the polar coordinate system used to
represent transmission line currents, in which each current has a magnitude and an angle.  It
is the maximum magnitudes of these currents that is constrained.  Previously, the code has applied
equal magnitude upper and lower bounds.  That is, for a positive real bound I_max, the constraints
were imposed on the current flow magnitude variable "I" as:

      –I_max <= I <=  + I_max     (old version)

But because the variable "I" represents a magnitude of a complex quantity, the correct upper and lower bounds should instead be:

      0 <= I <= +I_max     (new version)

The "I" quantity only appears in other equations as the magnitude of a complex quantity, that is, as  I*exp(zeta).  Therefore,
the effect of the incorrect inequalities was to create a non-uniqueness in solution; it did not change the feasible space in a PHYSICALLY
meaningful way (though it did enlarge the feasible space as seen by the solution algorithm, so could conceivably
have hurt convergence properties).

To illustrate, suppose that for the old version of the inequality, "I" was allowed to take a value of I=–0.8, and the
accompanying zeta = pi/4.  These values of the decision variables would be indistinguishable from I=+0.8, zeta=(pi/4 + pi).
The new version of the inequalities eliminates this redundancy.
